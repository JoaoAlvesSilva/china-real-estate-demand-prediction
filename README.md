https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/china-real-estate-demand-prediction

To run on a local machine, change the paths of the .env file using the path where you put the repository in.
Currently, this is configured to run in vscode.

The contents of this respository are as follows:

auxiliary: where I keep utils and static data. no need to read in detail and use as needed.

baseline_models : self-explanatory

eda: exploratory data analysis. keeping notebooks that I find useful

plots: the time evolution of 'Transaction Amounts' per sector. It is illustrative to take a look to see how noisy the dataset is.

submissions: the submissions that I've made

train : where the training data is
